# Set: A Card Matching Game Coded in Java

### Project Description

Set is a card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. I take no credit for the conception of the game itself. However, I thought it would be a great challenge to create a coded version of it in multiple languages, so I made this game using pure Java first, and then I designed [this](https://github.com/Anna-Okada/vue-set-game) front end version using Vue. Check out my [front end version](https://jocular-praline-bd2d89.netlify.app) on Netlify!

### Overview

I decided to create this version of Set using Java because I had studied Vue in Tech Elevator’s bootcamp and wanted to brush up my skills with Java and OOP. I chose Set in particular because I had loved playing it since I was a kid and because I knew it would present a challenge due to the complex logic involved in the game. I ended up not only brushing up on languages and concepts, but I also learned how to sit with challenges, look up relevant information, and develop creative solutions.
Throughout the process of creating this game, I encountered many interesting challenges. For example, I needed a way to represent the cards within the constraints of a CLI. I decided to look at what symbols were available and found some that would work. I also wanted the user to be able to progress through the game even if they were stumped, so I created a means of revealing Sets. I also wanted to allow users to play in solo or two player modes, so I created both versions.
Over the course of several weeks, I chipped away at this game, when I wasn’t busy performing violin, teaching, or being a mom! I was fortunate to receive guidance and insight from my wonderful mentor, Margaret, from Tech Elevator, and my dear friend, Alice, who is an alumna of TE.
I hope that this version of Set is as fun to play as the original game, and I hope you enjoy the unique design and multiple game modes, as well!
